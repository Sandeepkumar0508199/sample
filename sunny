Subject: Follow-Up on Azure Resources and Databricks Access

Hello Stephen,

Following up on our recent discussion, could you please confirm if weâ€™re clear to proceed with the creation of new Azure resources (such as the database, storage account, etc.) as well as the setup of new user groups for the Azure Databricks workspace?

This will allow us to manage folder-level access within the workspace as planned. Please advise at your earliest convenience so we can move forward accordingly.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Hi SMBC ASRA Team,
I am requesting an ASRA and EOI refresh for our Communications Surveillance extension.
Application Details:

Application Name: CPAD Data Analytics
Service Owner: Darren Hamilton
Request: We are extending our existing CPAD Analytics Environment to include Communications Surveillance capabilities. This requires updated ASRA and EOI assessments.
Please let me know what additional information you need to proceed.
Thank you,
