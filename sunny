Subject: Follow-Up on Azure Resources and Databricks Access

Hello Stephen,

Following up on our recent discussion, could you please confirm if we’re clear to proceed with the creation of new Azure resources (such as the database, storage account, etc.) as well as the setup of new user groups for the Azure Databricks workspace?

This will allow us to manage folder-level access within the workspace as planned. Please advise at your earliest convenience so we can move forward accordingly.

Best regards,

Hi SMBC ASRA Team,
I am requesting an ASRA and EOI refresh for our Communications Surveillance extension.
Application Details:
Application Number: 12087
Application Name: CPAD Data Analytics
Service Owner: Darren Hamilton
Request: We are extending our existing CPAD Analytics Environment to include Communications Surveillance capabilities. This requires updated ASRA and EOI assessments.
Please let me know what additional information you need to proceed.
Thank you,
Sandeep Kumar

Hi Darren,

We are extending our existing CPAD Analytics Environment to accommodate and streamline Comms Surveillance related Model Validation, Evaluation, and Monitoring workflows.

We believe the existing EOI and ASRA remain valid, and we’d like to proceed with the submission. Since the due date is 19th June 2025, could you please review and let us know if there are any questions or concerns before we move forward?

For your reference, here are the links to the relevant documents:

EOI Form: [Insert EOI link here]

ASRA Form: [Insert ASRA link here]

Would you also be available for a quick 15-minute call to align on this?

Best regards,
Sandeep
