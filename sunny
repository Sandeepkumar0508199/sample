Subject: Follow-Up on Azure Resources and Databricks Access

Hello Stephen,

Following up on our recent discussion, could you please confirm if weâ€™re clear to proceed with the creation of new Azure resources (such as the database, storage account, etc.) as well as the setup of new user groups for the Azure Databricks workspace?

This will allow us to manage folder-level access within the workspace as planned. Please advise at your earliest convenience so we can move forward accordingly.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
